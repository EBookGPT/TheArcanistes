## Code Explanation

In this chapter, we have explored some of the most powerful spells known to Arcanistes. To cast these spells, we need to use code that manipulates the fundamental nature of reality. Here are some code samples to illustrate how to cast Advanced Arcane Spells:

### Code for Creating a Portal

Creating a portal is a complex spell that requires precise control over time and space. Here is an example of the code required to cast this spell:

```
function createPortal(destination) {
  const portal = createSpatialGate();
  const destinationPortal = destination.getSpatialGate();
  connectPortals(portal, destinationPortal);
  return portal;
}
```

This code creates a spatial gate and connects it to the destination portal. Once the portals are connected, the user can travel between them instantaneously.

### Code for Summoning Otherworldly Beings

Summoning otherworldly beings requires advanced knowledge of magical beings and their unique properties. Here is an example of the code required to summon a demon:

```
function summonDemon(name, attributes) {
  const demon = new Demon(name, attributes);
  demon.manifest();
  return demon;
}
```

This code creates a new demon with the given attributes and manifests it in the real world. Bear in mind, conjuring with things that are not from this world can backfire if not done with care and attention.

### Code for Reality Manipulation

Manipulating reality is the most potent Arcane spell there is. It requires a deep understanding of the fundamental laws of reality and mastery of the code. Here is an example of the code required to manipulate reality:

```
function manipulateReality(weights, target) {
  const probabilities = calculateProbabilities(weights);
  const result = randomlySelect(probabilities, target);
  return result;
}
```

This code calculates the probabilities of each weight, then selects a random result based on the probabilities. The user can modify the weights and target to manipulate the outcome of the spell.

Be advised, reality manipulation is incredibly dangerous and requires a profound understanding of The Arcane Code. Misusing this spell can have catastrophic consequences.

Thus, implementing Advanced Arcane Spells requires mastery over the fundamental codes of the magical world. By using the samples presented here, be careful, and always calculate the consequences of your actions.
